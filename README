This repository has just begun.


Interesting patterns
    Creational
        Singleton
        Factory

    Structural

    Behavioural



TODO
    The root directory should have the patterns

    Perhaps each pattern dir should have it's only build file

    Under each pattern directory,
    should be the different language implementations.

    I'll need a workspace for every language.
